import { Canvas, Story } from '@storybook/addon-docs';

Buttons trigger interactions throughout the experience.
Use them for things such as confirming or submitting forms, cancelling actions, opening or closing dialogs, or moving forwards or backwards in workflows.

Do not use them for navigational links; instead, use a [Link component]().

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--secondary" />
</Canvas>

## Variations

There are several variations of the Button used in different designs.

Add the `primary` attribute to use the primary color from theming.
This should be used for the primary action on a screen, such as submitting a form.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--primary" />
</Canvas>

Add the `size="small"` attribute to use a smaller version of the button.
This should be used inline alongside text content.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--small" />
</Canvas>

## Accessibility

Buttons should always participate in tab ordering for keyboard users.
